I forked this project from https://github.com/ArthurHub/HTML-Renderer (thank you so much)

I added some features

such as

1) dynamic html dom

2) decoupling, dependency analysis

3) optimizing the html,css parser (moving to Html5/Css3!)

4) add svg/canvas support (not complete)

5) abstract canvas backend (GDI+, OpenGL) also not complete for Linux (for the canvas backend, I used it from another project -> https://github.com/prepare/agg-sharp)

6) Javascript (v8) binding (https://github.com/prepare/vroomjs)

7) debug view

8) more layout support eg. inline-block,relative, absolute ,fixed, flex  etc 

9) added custom controls eg. text editer control, scrollbar, gridbox etc.

10) some events (eg. mouse /keyboard events)

.. BUT not complete :( 

feel free to fork/ comment/ suggest /pull request 




#license

#plan

1) always permissive licencse (MIT,BSD, Apache2)

2) bind some features from Blink engine

3) add more html5/css3/js support

4) convert to C++ code with some transpiler tools 
   so users can build a final native code web browser

5) to make this runs on .NetCore

Nice to meet you!
