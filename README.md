#Hello !

I fork this project from https://github.com/ArthurHub/HTML-Renderer
I added some features.. BUT not complete :( 

such as

1) dynamic html dom

2) decoupling, dependency analysis

3) optimizing the html,css parser (but not Html5/Css3)

4) add svg/canvas support (not complete)

5) abstract canvas backend (GDI+, OpenGL) also not complete for Linux (for the canvas backend, I used it from another project -> https://github.com/prepare/agg-sharp)

6) Javascript (v8) binding 

7) more layout support eg. inline-block,relative, absolte etc

#license
it is a C# project with permissive license( MIT,BSD, Apache2)

#plan:

1) always permissive licencse (MIT,BSD, Apache2)

2) bind some features from Blink engine

3) add more html5/css3/js support

4) convert to C++ code with some transpiler tools 
   so users can build a final native code web browser



feel free to comment/ suggest

Nice to meet you!
